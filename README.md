# My personal iWatch chatter #

Assume you are without your mobile, just a smart watch and Wi-Fi. And you'd like to chat with someone.

ping-me will supply such ability: from the watch, use Surfify (or Safari hidden browser (from iMessages)) to browse to some basic web-site, and ping your buddy along with your geo-location.

Now your buddy can text you using WhatsApp - in which answering is possible.
